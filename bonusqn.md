Time Travelling Stonks Man
Stonks

Background
It is the year 2037.
After making several poor stocks decisions in volatile stocks, you've lost most of your life savings.

Out of desperation, you recall a family heirloom stashed in a dusty corner of the storeroom that has been untouched for several decades.

Thinking that you could sell it for some cash, you brush off the dust to discover that its actually a strange never-before-seen contraption. After further investigation you realize that its a time machine capable of travelling into the past.

Pressing a dust-covered button, the machine lights up and asks you to select a specific year to travel to. From the corner of your eye, you notice that there is a battery icon, indicating the limited amount of energy remaining in the time machine.

In the heat of the moment, you decide to go back in time to purchase stocks. With the power of google, you know the historical stock prices and aim to make the most amount of money through buying and selling at the most optimal time across the years.

Scrounging up the rest of your savings, armed with historical stock prices and keeping in mind the remaining energy in the machine, you swear to return back to the year 2037 while earning the highest profits.

Challenge description
Travel back in time to maximize the amount of profits from buying and selling stocks in different years before returning back to 2037.

Requirement
Expose a POST endpoint /stonks on your application
Rules
You must return back to the year 2037
Once a stock in a given year is bought, it is permanently gone
To travel 1 year, it will cost the time travel machine 1 energy, and this scales linearly
Traveling 10 years will cost 10 energy

Format of output
Nested array, with each sub-array corresponding to a specific test case
Each sub-array contains a list of actions to execute in sequence
Each action is made up of 3 segments
Action Type:
i. j - Jump
ii. b - Buy
iii. s - Sell

Expected response content type: application/json

Sample calculation of profits
j-2037-2036
Jump from year 2037 to year 2036
b-Apple-50
Buy 50 Apple stocks at $10 = $500
j-2036-2037
Jump from year 2036 to year 2037
s-Apple-50
Sell 50 Apple stocks at $100 = $5000
Profit: $5000 - $500 = $4500
